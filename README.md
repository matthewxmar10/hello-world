# hello-world
My introduction to GitHub!

My name is Matthew Martin, and I am currently a 23-year-old from Alva, Oklahoma. I just finished 4.5 years at the Universityf of Oklahoma working toward my Advertising degree, but have recently decided to change paths toward a more compute science/programming direction. In the near future, I'm hoping to dive deep into JavaScript and AngularJS, as well as pick up some HTML, CSS, and other languages/frameworks along the way. My goal for this upcoming year is to finish my degree in Advertising (since I am so close to being finished), as well as tack on a minor in CS. I would then like to relocate for an internship or job opportunity while living out of my van that I will be converting this upcoming spring.

I am excited for life going forward, and I am excited to be learning on this journey!
